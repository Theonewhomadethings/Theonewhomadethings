## About me ðŸ‘‹

I am a 3rd year Physics student currently pursuing a BSc at Royal Holloway. After I achieve my BSC, the plan is to work in the industry for several years to gain hands on experience working with the most up to date leading-edge technologies. At some stage I will gain my Masters and specialize in either Quantum Physics, AI research or what ever captivates me at that future time and return to work in the industry.

I am an enthusiastic problem solver with a curious mind. I am passionate about; AI, Engineering and Quantitative trading.

## ðŸ’¬ A little background about me and my coding Journey ðŸ’¬ :

My Primary language is Python as it is the language I have the most experience using and at first I used it mostly in the scientific programming landscape. Scientific Programming means after I perform lab experiments we would typically use python to visualize data and analyse these results to draw conclusions from the effect or concept we are studying. 

However, I am at the stage now where I am self learning abstract CS theory and programming fundamentals which I skipped when I first started coding as I am not a CS major, so I wouldn't typically learn this at a Uni setting. The goal was to learn Algorithms and Data structures using online resources to be able to utilise Python to an advanced level. I would describe myself as a strong intermediate python programmer right now. To really leverage Python properly I am studying Object-Orientated programming as well and building projects using more interesting tricks. 

I have experience also using C++ and C which I have used for projects done in both an internship setting and in my degree. I would say I would say I am at a strong beginner level, approaching the intermediate stage for these languages. In my head to progress to the intermediate stage I need to build out some more projects in these languages which is the plan in the next coming months.  

In terms of Java this has been comepletely self learnt. Most Algorithms and Data structure courses and intro to programming courses I saw where taught in Java, so I decided to just pick it up and learn how to manipulate the data structures in this language and see how algorithms are implemented here. Then I would translate these implementations to python3. The courses I am doing right now are Princeton's Coursera course "Algorithms part 1" and Harvard's online CS50 intro to programming. Parallel to this, I am grinding leetcode to get used to writing efficient code and explore competitive programming.

 Current Languages
- Python
- C++   
- C     
- Java   

-----------------------------------

The goal for this Github profile is to:

-  Have a place to store my code generally while I am learning.
-  Build out my programming Portfolio, to showcase I can code.
-  Have fun and make some awesome projects!!!
